    "Transfer learning is a powerful technique in machine learning that allows a model trained on one task to be reused for a different but related task. Instead of starting from scratch, transfer learning leverages the knowledge a model has already gained from a large dataset and applies it to a new problem, which is particularly useful when labeled data for the new task is limited. Once trained, the lower layers of these models typically learn general features, such as edges in images or syntactic patterns in text, which can be useful across a range of tasks. By fine-tuning the upper layers of a pre-trained model or adding new layers specific to the new task, developers can adapt it to perform well with far fewer training examples. Properly executed transfer learning not only saves computational resources but also significantly reduces training time. It can also lead to better performance, particularly in scenarios where the target dataset is small or imbalanced. There are different strategies for transfer learning, such as freezing all or some of the layers during training, or allowing all layers to be updated depending on the similarity between the source and target tasks. For example, in medical imaging, models trained on natural images can be adapted to detect tumors or classify X-rays by fine-tuning only a few layers.\n",

    "An emerging category of models coined **'Foundation Models (FM)'** subset the transfer learning technique in which the model pretraining task is derived from raw unlabelled data rather than a specific task. In other words, these models are trained in a 'self-supervised' manner. These models potentially offer similar benefits to models developed using traditional transfer learning techniques (i.e reduced training time and performance). However, unlike with transfer learning, FMs circumvent the development of an intial large scale labelled task. This technique is especially powerful in the remote sensing world where the availability of large scale unprocessed data is unprecedented and the methods for transforming it into actionable insights draw from a wide range of scientific disciplines. **The larger goal of the earth observation foundation model (EOFM) development communitity is to create a model capable of generalizing across domains by learning from the structure and correlations iniherent in the raw data and open the door for more versatile models that can adapt with minimal fine-tuning. Attempts towards this ephemeral goal, however, must be thoroughly assessed in a way that is relavent to the greater remote sensing community.** \n",

    "Below are 3 common methods for pretraining a computer vision model in a self-supervised fashion. This is by no means not an exhaustive list! Due to widespread availability of satellite data, a number of variations and/or combinations of the methods below exist along with a number of alternative techniques that are not in widespread use. There is also an extensive effort to marry the computer vision and language domains both in and out of the remote sensing community. For simplicity, we omit those from this notebook. It is worth nothing that the listed paradigms are all 'transformer-based' where the core architecural unit is a vision-transformer trained under the 'encoder-decoder' paradigm. While it is important to understand the high level distinction between these techniques, it is not entirely necessary in order to implement them in practice as many developer groups have worked hard in abstracting most of the logic away in various frameworks. Deep understanding of each of these model families as well as the nuances of a transformer is out of the scope of this notebook but we encourage folks to learn as much as possible!\n",

    "\n",
    "Autoencoders consist of an encoder that compresses input images into a lower-dimensional latent space and a decoder that reconstructs the original images from these representations. This compression helps the model capture essential features while discarding noise or irrelevant details. The most dominent though not necessarily the most performant method is masked image modeling (i.e the 'Masked Autoencoder' (MAE)) where the model is tasked with reconstructing the masked part of an image from unmasked context. There are a handful of masking strageties that researchers have presented though they all work under the same overarching idea that a model optimized on the reconstruction task is generalizable, or able to perform well on unseen data.\n",

    "Contrastive models are tasked with distinguishing between similar and dissimilar image representations. It works by pulling together representations of positive pairs (different augmented views of the same image) while pushing apart representations of negative pairs, which are views from different images. Common methods include 'Simple Contrastive Learning' (SimCLR) and 'Momentum Contrast' (MoCo). Unlike autoencoders, a decoder is typically not included in the pretraining phase since the task is executed entirely in the latent space.\n",

    "Non-contrastive self-distillation is a self-supervised learning approach for computer vision that avoids the need for negative samples. Instead of contrasting different images, it trains a student network to match the output of a teacher network, both fed with different augmented views of the same image. The teacher is often an exponential moving average of the student, providing stable targets for the two encoders. The objective is to produce consistent, meaningful embeddings, not to reconstruct or generate the input. Common methods include 'Self-**di**stillation with **no** labels' (DINO) and 'Bootstrap Your Own Latent' (BYOL).\n",

    "You're probably wondering at this point, what do you do with the trained encoder? Just as you would with any trained neural network, you can load the weights for inference using similar code you might have seen in previous chapters. There is still one more consideration you must make depending on the type of task at hand and the shape of the output of the encoder. If, your goal is to classify images, a lightweight machine learning algorithm directly on top of the vector outputs of the encoders may be sufficient. The assumption here is that the internal representation of the image is robust and **relavent** to your task. These are the 'embeddings' you may have heard of recently and are analigous to large coarse resolution raster. We will touch on this topic in a separate chapter. If your goal, on the other hand, is to segment the images, we may need to train a subsequent neural network to extract from that internal representation and produce a useable map. Below is a summary list of contemporary decoders used in conjunction with transformer-based encoders. Each vary in complexity, purpose, and method in which they extract features from the transformer layers in the aforementioned encoders.\n",

    "\n",
    "The FCN is a stack of convolutional layers that upsamples and refines final feature maps produced by the transformer’s output embeddings and converts them back into an image-like spatial representation. This final representation can then be fed through a final prediction layer, which is typically itself convolutional layers, to produce the final map. This is typically more lightweight than some of the MLP-based decoders below, due to weight sharing in the learned kernel filters. Local context is also explicitly emphasized as those same kernel filters may only cover a small portion of the whole input image.\n",

    "Segformers use a MLP style decoder to extract from a hierarchical transformer-based encoder. Originally developed as a standalone framework for end to end training, the segformer has been recently adapted by a handful of research groups attempting to utilize the representation generated by the pretraining phase. The assumption is that the implementation of the transformer blocks in the encoder are sufficiently hierarchical in nature such that they can be composed using this method.\n",

    "Similar to the segformer architecture, the upernet leverages multi-scale hierarchical features to generate dense predictions. Rather than MLPs, the upernet utilizes pooling layers and convolutions to compose the features before the final prediction layers. It's worth noting here that the upernet was designed with a ResNet-50 backbone that was fine tuned. In other words, this closely aligns with the 'pretrained encoder' with a decoder head methology that has been popularized in the last year.\n",

But this decoder is still useful in assessing representation quality as it is cheap to train and can be implemented in a consistently, making it an ideal tool for benchmarking. This technique is taken from the language domain where large language models are often evaluated on downstream tasks with linear probes on frozen embeddings before doing full fine-tuning. \n",

    "A more recent decoder development in the computer vision realm. Similar to both the Segformer and the UperNet, hierarchical features play an important role in it's predictive strength with the most important distinction here being that the decoder itself is also transformer based. Also similar to the UperNet, the MUSTER decoder was designed to integrate with pretrained encoders. While this may lend it self to greater performance, it is important to consider the compute required to implement such an architecture.\n"

It also includes a relatively simple dataset integration scheme along with additional decoder heads integrated by the team at Spatial Informatics Group for the purpose of evaluating methods for extracting the information from the internal representation of the foundation model. The limited dependency is especially beneficial for small scale demonstrations such as this learning notebook. You will find similar themes found in previous chapters of the Applied Deep Learning Book such as dataloaders, pytorch modules, loss functions, etc. These are not exclusiive to training end to end models and in fact, the workflow is almost exactly the same!

    "CUDA is the underlying software running NVidia GPUs. While it is not necessary, we recommend running this notebook in a CUDA enabled linux environment for convenience and setup simplicity. We also recommend installing python>=3.10 either standalone or through a conda managed environment. For running the model, we can estimate a VRAM required for storing the model using a simple calculation of # of parameters and precision. For example, a 300M parameter model at 32bit precision would roughly require 3.6GB to store the weights and optimizer states. Another 1.2 GB is required for the gradients of each of those parameters and a few more for the data itself. Likewise, the decoder used to extract from the internal representation also imposes VRAM / compute requirements. There's no universal formula here, but tools like PyTorch hooks, torch.cuda.memory_summary(), or profilers can help estimate how much compute you need. 12GB of VRAM is a good place to start and luckily there are free google colab options at this compute scale, but, there is a trend towards larger and more complex models which inevitably consume more compute.

    "### Frozen vs Unfrozen vs Random vs LoRA\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing frozen, unfrozen, and randomly initialized pretrained encoders is useful in understanding the value and applicability of transfer learning for a specific task. A frozen encoder uses pretrained weights without updating them during training. This setup helps evaluate how useful the pretrained features are on their own, especially in cases where the target dataset is small or the model is prone to overfitting. In contrast, an unfrozen encoder allows those pretrained weights to be updated, enabling the model to adapt its learned representations to better suit the target task. This approach often yields better performance when sufficient labeled data is available and the task deviates from the original pretraining domain however, requires that additional gradients be computed and stored. On the other hand, a randomly initialized encoder serves as a baseline, providing a measure of how well the model performs without any prior knowledge. Comparing results from this setup against those using pretrained weights helps quantify the benefits of pretraining in terms of training time and overall final performance. It's worth noting that depending on the task and the amount of available training data, the randomly initialized encoder may never achieve the same results as an unfrozen pretrained model. This behavior is still an on going area of research. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, these three basic configurations allow for a comprehensive assessment of whether transfer learning is useful, whether fine-tuning improves results, and whether pretraining is necessary at all for a specific task. There is a fourth method which we will not use here called Low Rank Adaption (LoRA) and is somewhat of a compromise between a fully frozen and unfrozen encoder. For larger models (i.e greater than 300m parameters). Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a technique used to efficiently fine-tune large pretrained neural networks by injecting small, trainable weight matrices into the model, while keeping the original weights frozen. Traditional fine-tuning updates all parameters of a model, which becomes expensive for large models. LoRA avoids this by approximating the weight updates as the product of two low-rank matrices, significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters. This low-rank decomposition acts as a bottleneck, enforcing efficiency and reducing overfitting. LoRA has gained popularity particularly with large language models. It also enables modular fine-tuning where separate LoRA modules can be swapped in for different tasks making it attractive for applications requiring task specialization without retraining the entire model.\n"

Rather than contrasting positive and negative samples, the CHROMA framework contrasts optical and radar data using separate encoders then combines those embeddings using cross attention with a unifying transformer encoder. The output of this terminal encoder is then randomly masked and trained in a typical encoder-decoder MIM style. The optical encoder requires all 12 spectral bands from Sentinel 2 while the radar encoder requires the 2 polarization bands from Sentinel 1. In our downstream task, we are limited to 6 harmonized spectral bands. How can we expect this to impact our results?\n",

    "\n",
    "Below are the results from running the above commands aggregated into relatively simple charts. Keep in mind, we only train for 16 epochs for the purpose of a simple demonstration. This is a very small amount of time for a deep learning model. There is a reasonable chance that these metrics will change given enough training time, a different loss function, or a different set of hyperparameters. The framework allows for some level of configuration. On your own, try setting new configurations (see ./pangaea-bench/configs for details).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Training Graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "In spite of a limited training window, we see a fairly distinct training curve which suggests the models have learned some useful features. Whether this is due to the pretraining or the simple nature of the task is still an open question. A straightforward test for that is to train using a randomly initialized encoder simply by adjusting the last configuration in each training command to null. In addition, there is a clear loss difference between each model with DOFA generally having higher cross entropy loss.\n",

    "#### Decoder Choice\n",
    "\n",
    "The test metrics for the checkpoint saved at the final epoch tells a slightly different story. Overall, the CROMA combinations appear to be the most effective in terms of overall performance metrics (F1 and IoU). The PRITHVI encoder consistently shows good performance across different decoders, with the Linear Probe surprisingly being the top performer in this group. The DOFA Linear Probe combination stands out as an outlier with extremely low performance for burn scar detection. The lower performance of the probe into DOFA suggests their internal representatioin may not be appropriate for this task and the decoder might be doing the bulk of the heavy lifting in the other runs. More experimentation is required to confirm this. It's worth noting that for even with the same encoder, varying the decoder has a visible affect on performance that is comparible in magnitude to the differences between encoders.\n",

    "Looking at per class metrics gives a bit more insight into what's happening. Save for the DOFA-linear-probe outlier, the differences from model to model is realistically negligible (statistical test would be recommended to confirm this). However, when we look at per class metrics, we see a more noticeable difference between each model's ability to segment the positive class. This suggests a class imbalance issue. While this may be an accurate representation of the task, this is something that needs to be taken into account when designing a benchmark dataset and evaluation framework.\n",

CROMA consumed up to ~3 times the memory and up to ~9 times the training time than some of the other models for the same number of epochs. In other words, for the same resources, DOFA combined with an even larger decoder trained for 128 epochs instead of 16 may very well outperform the CROMA models. In the same vein, PRITHVI consumed a comparable amount of memory to CROMA but is far simpler and to implement and fine tunes several times faster. \n",

    "We have all these metrics and they all tell a similar story. Lets look at some of the outputs! Afterall, the end product should be a map. The first thing you should notice below is that the annotation is not perfect! So the metrics above should be interpreted carefully. For example, the prithvi masks from all decoders look vastly different while the metrics say otherwise. When the benchmark dataset was created, chip labels that contained multiple annotations in close proximity were likely left unfiltered. This does offer an opportunity to see how a model behaves in such situations which are frankly, all too common. Interestingly whether or not the model captures the false negatives depends mostly on the decoder. In addtion, there are artifacts in the FCN variations that arise from the structure of the decoder itself rather than anything meaningful from the image.\n",

    "You may have noticed in spite being a small decoder, the linear probe into PRITHVI had comparable performance to the larger models in this given task. While this may be attributed to the limited training time or architectural design choices, the more likely reason is that PRITHVI 1.0 was trained exclusively on HLS scenes. Foundation Models, like all machine learning models, are shaped by their source data and making them truly generalizabile is an ongoing problem. Likewise, spatiotemporal patterns are diverse in both downstream tasks and sensor data. Ultimately when selecting a base model, one of the first things to consider before benchmarking metrics is how well does the pretraining dataset align with your given task."

    "### A Well Defined Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Benchmarks such as ImageNet for vision tasks or GLUE for language tasks have helped standardize comparisons, but emerging domains may lack such comprehensive baselines. In such cases, creating task-specific benchmarks becomes more necessary especially when these \"Foundation Models\" become more and more prominent. Like all standardized evaluations, benchmarks can often promote excessive metric fixation. Even so, these metrics are necessary when comparing across models and must be done under the same conditions: using the same dataset splits, preprocessing steps, and evaluation protocols. Differences in any of these factors can distort the interpretation of results. For that reason, we see testing in multiple controlled conditions an essential step for a robust evaluation. In our simplified example above, we vary the decoder attached to each frozen pretrained encoder as the quality of the internal representation is only as good as how easily we can extract from it. Model complexity, training time, and inference speed are also crucial metrics to consider, especially in deployment scenarios where computational resources or latency requirements are constrained.\n",
    "\n",
    "A well defined benchmark must incorperate all of these factors while also driving innovation. Burn scar mapping has been achieved using common remote sensing techniques with vastly smaller scale compute requirements. Lets look at a related but more difficult problem: burn intensity mapping ([see here](https://www.mtbs.gov/) for more details). Categorizing each pixel for all burns is a non-trivial task and the dNBR thresholding while powerful, has some drawbacks, namely, the time frame with clear enough imagery to make a meaningful assessment.\n"
