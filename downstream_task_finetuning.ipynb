    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Transfer learning is a powerful technique in machine learning that allows a model trained on one task to leverage the previously learned features and be reused for a different but related task. Instead of starting from scratch, transfer learning leverages the knowledge a model has already gained from a separate, and usually large, dataset and applies it to a new problem. This is particularly useful when a dataset is small or annotations for the new task are limited. Once an initial training has been completed, the layers towards the front (closer to the input layer) of these models typically learn general features, such as edges in images or syntactic patterns in text, which can be useful across a wide range of tasks. Ideally, by fine-tuning the initial layers of a pre-trained model or adding new layers specific to the new task, practicioners can adapt it to perform well with far fewer training samples. This also has the potential to improve performance thresholds for a given smaller or imbalanced dataset, as the pre-trained model already has latent feature extraction capabilities from prior training.  Properly executed transfer learning not only has the potential to boost performance, but it also saves computational resources and significantly reduces training time. There are different strategies for transfer learning, such as freezing different sets of layers during training, or allowing all layers to be updated, depending on the similarity between the source (initial) and target (new) tasks. For example, in medical imaging, models trained on natural images can be adapted to detect tumors or classify X-rays by fine-tuning only a few layers.\n",

    "An emerging category of models coined **'Foundation Models (FM)'** subset the transfer learning technique in which a given model's pretraining task is derived from a model learning to represent, extract features, and reconstruct raw unlabelled data. This is in contrast to traditional supervised learning problems that aim to map data samples to a annotations from a specific task. In other words, these FMs are trained in a 'self-supervised' manner and potentially offer similar benefits to models developed using traditional transfer learning techniques (i.e reduced training time and performance). However, unlike with transfer learning, FMs circumvent the development of an intial large scale labelled task. This technique is especially powerful in the remote sensing world where the availability of large scale unprocessed data is an ever-increasing, and the methods for transforming it into actionable insights draw from a wide range of scientific disciplines. **The larger goal of the earth observation foundation model (EOFM) development communitity is to create models capable of generalizing across Earth Science domains and remote sensing modalities by learning from the structure and correlations iniherent in the raw data, and open the door for a wider group of practice and more versatile models that can adapt with minimal fine-tuning. Attempts towards this ephemeral goal, however, must be thoroughly assessed in a way that adheres not just to typical computer vision analysis, but also to the rigor required for the underlying science goals and that is relavent to the greater remote sensing community.** \n",

    "This notebook will cover: a simplified understanding of EOFMs, how to utilize them, evaluate their intermediate ability to extract and represent data features, benchmark their performance, and what to consider when assessing their utility for your downstream task. We assume that you have some familiarity with training deep learning model and the software associated with that process as well as a high level understanding of concepts such as network weights, back propagation, and checkpoints.\n",

    "\n",
    "Below are 3 common methods for pretraining a computer vision model in a self-supervised fashion. This is by no means not an exhaustive list! Due to widespread availability of satellite data, a number of variations and/or combinations of the methods below exist along with a number of alternative techniques that are not in widespread use. There is also an extensive effort to interconnect strides made separately within the computer vision and natural language processing domains both in and out of the remote sensing community. For simplicity, we omit those from this notebook. It is worth nothing that the models described and tested here are all 'transformer-based' where the core architecural unit is a vision-transformer trained under the 'encoder-decoder' paradigm (to be discussed). While it is important to understand the high level distinction between these techniques, it is not entirely necessary in order to implement them in practice as many developer groups have worked hard in abstracting most of the logic away in various frameworks. Deep understanding of each of these model families as well as the nuances of a transformer is out of the scope of this notebook but we encourage folks to learn as much as possible! The deeper a practicioner's knowledge, the easier it will be to disctinguish between appropriate and inappropriate practices both with data and the associated model training and deployment.\n",

    "\n",
    "Autoencoders consist of an encoder that projects input images into a (typically)lower-dimensional latent space and a decoder that reconstructs the original images from these representations. This compression helps the model capture essential features while discarding noise or irrelevant details. The most dominent, though not necessarily the most performant, training method is masked image modeling (i.e the 'Masked Autoencoder' (MAE)) where the model is tasked with reconstructing the masked part of an image from unmasked context. There are a handful of masking strageties that researchers have presented though they all work under the same overarching idea that a model optimized on the reconstruction can represent dataset-inherrent features well and is generalizable, or able to perform well on unseen or new data samples.\n",

    "Contrastive models are tasked with distinguishing between similar and dissimilar image representations. It works by pulling together representations of positive pairs (different augmented views of the same image) while pushing apart representations of negative pairs, which are views from different images. Common methods include 'Simple Contrastive Learning' (SimCLR) and 'Momentum Contrast' (MoCo). Unlike autoencoders, a decoder is typically not included in the pretraining phase since the task is executed entirely in the latent space. This methodology also typically requires some level of annotation - creating positive / negative pairs within the training data and can sometimes be referenced to as a 'semi-supervised' methodology.\n",

The teacher is often an exponential moving average of the student, providing stable targets for the two encoders. The objective is to produce consistent, meaningful embeddings, not to reconstruct or generate the input.

    "#### Encoder Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "For the evaluation of encoders, as with traditional supervised tasks, performance should not rely solely on evaluation of the objective function on training and validation subsets of the data. While this is slightly different than evaluating the performance of a model on its ultimate skill of properly mapping input samples to a target distribution, the same principals should apply - a test subset of data previously unseen to the model should be used to evaluate the model's ability to perform the task at hand in quantitative and qualitative methods. Another benefit of using encoder / decoder paradigmatic architectures the fact that the intermediate separation in the model can be used to evaluate representational skill.\n",
    "\n",
    "While this chapter is not focused on dataset accumulation, it should also be mentioned that proper splitting of the data in a geospatial setting is imperative for proper evaluation and should consider variables like keeping unseen spatiotemporal areas for (a test set) independent post-training evaluation of a model. This ensures that complex spatiotemporal cues built into geospatial datasets are not \"memorized\" and overstate a model's performance on a given task and potential generalizability (LaHaye et al., 2021; Jakubik et al., 2023). Here we discuss some ways an encoder's representational \"skill\" can be measured and evaluated by looking at both the weight matrix of the model and the output of the encoder, or intermediate data representation called encodings or embeddings. Unlike the metrics used for downstream task evaluation, many of these are newer and therefore less known. Here we provide a brief description and references for each methodology used.\n",

    "##### <u>Resource Requirements</u> \n",
    " \n",
    "Understanding the resource demands of deep learning models is crucial for both model selection and hardware planning. As data science practicioners, we typically we want to balance performance, interpretability, and resource requirements as three main driving factors in model selection. It is also crucial that we aim to choose the smallest and most efficient model that meets the requirements for our task in these three areas. This is important not only for the sake of efficiency, but also because the environmental impact of large-scale deep learning models has become a significant concern as model sizes and computational demands continue to grow. Choosing small and optimized models where appropriate is an effective strategy for reducing the emissions and energy consumption footprint associated with model development and deployment (Strubell et al., 2019; Patterson et al., 2021) . These considerations should also include a model's pretraining phase as well as resources required for operational inference.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " Three commonly used metrics Floating Point Operations (FLOPs), Multiply-Accumulate Operations (MACs), and parameter counts offer practical proxies for estimating these requirements. FLOPs denote the total number of floating-point operations (additions, multiplications, etc.) required to process a single input through the model. High FLOPs indicate a model that requires substantial computation resources, which can translate directly to longer inference and training times.MACs refer to the number of multiply-accumulate operations, foundational to neural network layers (especially in convolutions and matrix multiplications). MACs are closely linked to the actual physical operations that deep learning accelerators (like GPUs and TPUs) execute, thus providing an estimate of real computational workload. The parameter count measures the total number of learnable variables (weights and biases) are within a model. The number of parameters is a large driver for the memory required to load and store the model during execution and on disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some limitations that should be considered:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) FLOPs are platform-agnostic and do not directly account for hardware-specific optimizations or parallelization capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) MACs are specifically meaningful for models dominated by linear algebra; other operations (e.g., activations, normalizations) may not be included in MAC counts\n",

    "##### <u>Weight Matrix Analysis for a Data-Free Assessment of Training Quality</u> \n",
    "\n",
    "The Weight Watcher analysis library introduces the measure of an implicit form of self-regularization, as revealed by the spectral properties of a model's weight matrices (Martin et al.,  2021). The toolkit and associated papers apply Random Matrix Theory (RMT), a branch of mathematics that studies the properties of matrices whose entries are random variables and more specifically Empirical Spectral Density (ESD) analysis, the characterization of the distribution of eigenvalues of a given matrix—often large, random, or structured matrices forming a histogram that represents how the eigenvalues are distributed across their range of possible values. As a part of this analysis, the $\\alpha$ parameter is an exponent characterizing the tail of the empirical spectral density (ESD) of a neural network layer’s weight matrix. When the distribution of singular values (or eigenvalues) of a weight matrix follows a power law distribution, the ESD behaves as: $\\rho$($\\lambda$)∼$\\lambda$−$\\alpha$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\lambda$ denotes the eigenvalues, and $\\alpha$ is the power law exponent. This exponent is estimated empirically from the tail of the ESD for a given layer. $\\alpha$ quantifies how \"heavy-tailed\" or \"spread out\" the layer's eigenvalue distribution is. A smaller $\\alpha$ means a heavier tail: the weight matrix has more large singular values, indicating more complex/lower-rank structure. In this context, this means a given layer captures not only the true structure but also the noise—too much complexity. A larger αα means a faster-decaying tail: the singular values decay rapidly, indicating dominance of noise-like randomness or over-regularization. Here, this means a given layer fails to capture the relevant data structure—too much simplicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we provide the means to do the full ESD-based analysis that the WeightWatcher tool provides, and use the. $\\alpha$ parameter as a summarization metric for the analysis.\n",

    "The Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) methodology for Dimension Reduction can be used to as both a general dimension reduction tool and as an interpretability / visualization tool, and here we use it for both. UMAP assumes data lies on a manifold and utilizes local approximations (k-nearest neighbor graphs) to represent the data’s topological and metric structure. Each local neighborhood is encoded as a fuzzy simplicial set, and then merged probabilistically to form a global topological structure (McInnes et al., 2020). Figure X provides a couple of examples of embeddings from different models and geospatial datasets projceted into a lower feature space using UMAP, and overlayed with each sample's target value. \n",

While this is a limitation of the tool, it is useful in two ways:\n",

    "You're probably wondering at this point, what do you do with the trained encoder? Just as you would with any trained neural network, you can load the weights for inference using similar code you might have seen in previous chapters. There is still one more consideration you must make depending on the type of task at hand and the shape of the output of the encoder. If, your goal is to classify images, a lightweight machine learning algorithm directly on top of the vector outputs of the encoders may be sufficient. The assumption here is that the internal representation of the image is robust and **relavent** to your task. These are the 'embeddings' you may have heard of recently and are analigous to large coarse resolution raster. We will touch on this topic in a separate chapter. If your goal, on the other hand, is to segment the images, we may need to train a subsequent neural network to extract from that internal representation and produce a useable map. Below is a summary list of contemporary decoders used in conjunction with transformer-based encoders. Each vary in complexity, purpose, and method in which they extract features from the transformer layers in the aforementioned encoders.\n",

This final representation can then be fed through a final prediction layer, which is typically itself convolutional layers, to produce the final map. This is typically more lightweight than some of the MLP-based decoders below, due to weight sharing in the learned kernel filters.

For running the model, we can estimate a VRAM required for storing the model using a simple calculation of # of parameters and precision. For example, a 300M parameter model at 32bit precision would roughly require 3.6GB to store the weights and optimizer states. Another 1.2 GB is required for the gradients of each of those parameters and a few more for the data itself. Likewise, the decoder used to extract from the internal representation also imposes VRAM / compute requirements. There's no universal formula here, but tools like PyTorch hooks, torch.cuda.memory_summary(), or profilers can help estimate how much compute you need. 12GB of VRAM is a good place to start and luckily there are free google colab options at this compute scale, but, there is a trend towards larger and more complex models which inevitably consume more compute.

    "### Frozen vs Unfrozen vs Random vs LoRA\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing frozen, unfrozen, and randomly initialized pretrained encoders is useful in understanding the value and applicability of transfer learning for a specific task. A frozen encoder uses pretrained weights without updating them during training. This setup helps evaluate how useful the pretrained features are on their own, especially in cases where the target dataset is small or the model is prone to overfitting. In contrast, an unfrozen encoder allows those pretrained weights to be updated, enabling the model to adapt its learned representations to better suit the target task. This approach often yields better performance when sufficient labeled data is available and the task deviates from the original pretraining domain however, requires that additional gradients be computed and stored. On the other hand, a randomly initialized encoder serves as a baseline, providing a measure of how well the model performs without any prior knowledge. Comparing results from this setup against those using pretrained weights helps quantify the benefits of pretraining in terms of training time and overall final performance. It's worth noting that depending on the task and the amount of available training data, the randomly initialized encoder may never achieve the same results as an unfrozen pretrained model. This behavior is still an on going area of research. \n",
    "Overall, these three basic configurations allow for a comprehensive assessment of whether transfer learning is useful, whether fine-tuning improves results, and whether pretraining is necessary at all for a specific task. There is a fourth method which we will not use here called Low Rank Adaption (LoRA) and is somewhat of a compromise between a fully frozen and unfrozen encoder. For larger models (i.e greater than 300m parameters). Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a technique used to efficiently fine-tune large pretrained neural networks by injecting small, trainable weight matrices into the model, while keeping the original weights frozen. Traditional fine-tuning updates all parameters of a model, which becomes expensive for large models. LoRA avoids this by approximating the weight updates as the product of two low-rank matrices, significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters. This low-rank decomposition acts as a bottleneck, enforcing efficiency and reducing overfitting. LoRA has gained popularity particularly with large language models. It also enables modular fine-tuning where separate LoRA modules can be swapped in for different tasks making it attractive for applications requiring task specialization without retraining the entire model.\n",

    "CROMA is a another transformer-based model with a slightly different approach combining both masked image modeling (MIM) and contrastive learning. Rather than contrasting positive and negative samples, the CROMA framework contrasts optical and radar data using separate encoders then combines those embeddings using cross attention with a unifying transformer encoder. The output of this terminal encoder is then randomly masked and trained in a typical encoder-decoder MIM style. The optical encoder requires all 12 spectral bands from Sentinel 2 while the radar encoder requires the 2 polarization bands from Sentinel 1. In our downstream task, we are limited to 6 harmonized spectral bands. How can we expect this to impact our results?\n",

    "\n",
    "Some things to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are the results from running the above commands aggregated into relatively simple charts. Keep in mind, we only train for 16 epochs for the purpose of a simple demonstration. This is a very small amount of time for a deep learning model. There is a reasonable chance that these metrics will change given enough training time, a different loss function, or a different set of hyperparameters. The framework allows for some level of configuration. On your own, try setting new configurations (see ./pangaea-bench/configs for details).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Training Graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "In spite of a limited training window, we see a fairly distinct training curve which suggests the models have learned some useful features. Whether this is due to the pretraining or the simple nature of the task is still an open question. A straightforward test for that is to train using a randomly initialized encoder simply by adjusting the last configuration in each training command to null. In addition, there is a clear loss difference between each model with DOFA generally having higher cross entropy loss.\n",

    "Figure 9: Training loss per step for all model varations. Each model was optimized on cross entropy loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Decoder Choice\n",
    "\n",
    "The test metrics for the checkpoint saved at the final epoch tells a slightly different story. Overall, the CROMA combinations appear to be the most effective in terms of overall performance metrics (F1 and IoU). The PRITHVI encoder consistently shows good performance across different decoders, with the Linear Probe surprisingly being the top performer in this group. The DOFA Linear Probe combination stands out as an outlier with extremely low performance for burn scar detection. The lower performance of the probe into DOFA suggests their internal representatioin may not be appropriate for this task and the decoder might be doing the bulk of the heavy lifting in the other runs. More experimentation is required to confirm this. It's worth noting that for even with the same encoder, varying the decoder has a visible affect on performance that is comparible in magnitude to the differences between encoders.\n",

    "#### Per Class Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at per class metrics gives a bit more insight into what's happening. Save for the DOFA-linear-probe outlier, the differences from model to model is realistically negligible (statistical test would be recommended to confirm this). However, when we look at per class metrics, we see a more noticeable difference between each model's ability to segment the positive class. This suggests a class imbalance issue. While this may be an accurate representation of the task, this is something that needs to be taken into account when designing a benchmark dataset and evaluation framework.\n",

CROMA consumed up to ~3 times the memory and up to ~9 times the training time than some of the other models for the same number of epochs. In other words, for the same resources, DOFA combined with an even larger decoder trained for 128 epochs instead of 16 may very well outperform the CROMA models. In the same vein, PRITHVI consumed a comparable amount of memory to CROMA but is far simpler and to implement and fine tunes several times faster. \n",

    "We have all these metrics and they all tell a similar story. Lets look at some of the outputs! Afterall, the end product should be a map. The first thing you should notice below is that the annotation is not perfect! So the metrics above should be interpreted carefully. For example, the prithvi masks from all decoders look vastly different while the metrics say otherwise. When the benchmark dataset was created, chip labels that contained multiple annotations in close proximity were likely left unfiltered. This does offer an opportunity to see how a model behaves in such situations which are frankly, all too common. Interestingly whether or not the model captures the false negatives depends mostly on the decoder. In addtion, there are artifacts in the FCN variations that arise from the structure of the decoder itself rather than anything meaningful from the image.\n",

    "\n",
    "You may have noticed in spite being a small decoder, the linear probe into PRITHVI had comparable performance to the larger models in this given task. While this may be attributed to the limited training time or architectural design choices, the more likely reason is that PRITHVI 1.0 was trained exclusively on HLS scenes. Foundation Models, like all machine learning models, are shaped by their source data and making them truly generalizabile is an ongoing problem. Likewise, spatiotemporal patterns are diverse in both downstream tasks and sensor data. Ultimately when selecting a base model, one of the first things to consider before benchmarking metrics is how well does the pretraining dataset align with your given task."

    "### A Well Defined Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Benchmarks such as ImageNet for vision tasks or GLUE for language tasks have helped standardize comparisons, but emerging domains may lack such comprehensive baselines. In such cases, creating task-specific benchmarks becomes more necessary especially when these \"Foundation Models\" become more and more prominent. Like all standardized evaluations, benchmarks can often promote excessive metric fixation. Even so, these metrics are necessary when comparing across models and must be done under the same conditions: using the same dataset splits, preprocessing steps, and evaluation protocols. Differences in any of these factors can distort the interpretation of results. For that reason, we see testing in multiple controlled conditions an essential step for a robust evaluation. In our simplified example above, we vary the decoder attached to each frozen pretrained encoder as the quality of the internal representation is only as good as how easily we can extract from it. Model complexity, training time, and inference speed are also crucial metrics to consider, especially in deployment scenarios where computational resources or latency requirements are constrained.\n",
    "\n",
    "A well defined benchmark must incorperate all of these factors while also driving innovation. Burn scar mapping has been achieved using common remote sensing techniques with vastly smaller scale compute requirements. Lets look at a related but more difficult problem: burn intensity mapping ([see here](https://www.mtbs.gov/) for more details). Categorizing each pixel for all burns is a non-trivial task and the dNBR thresholding while powerful, has some drawbacks, namely, the time frame with clear enough imagery to make a meaningful assessment.\n"
